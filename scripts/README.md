# Operational Scripts

Utility helpers for running or maintaining the PPTX MCP server live here.

- Add CLI helpers (e.g., bulk note formatting, environment setup) to this folder.
- Run scripts from the repo root with `python3 scripts/<script>.py` after `python3 -m pip install -e .`.
- Keep operational scripts separate from the packaged code under `src/`.
